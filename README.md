# Robust Command-Conditional Imitation Learning for End-to-End Autonomnous Driving

## Description
This repository contains the code developed for my master thesis "Robust Command-Conditional Imitation Learning for End-to-End Autonomnous Driving" at University of Technology Graz. The code provides Training Pipelines, Inference Code and CARLA Benchmarks used in my thesis.

## Further Information
Because of file size limitations, this repository does not contain all model results presented in the Thesis, nor does it contain the complete data sets used.
The MH-0, SH-0, MH-3 and SH-5 models from the thesis are provided. Also provided is a very small example dataset in the recordings folder.
